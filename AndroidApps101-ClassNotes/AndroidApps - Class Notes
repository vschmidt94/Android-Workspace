Setting up Emulator
* FN+F11 = rotate screen shortcut (or some version of F11)
* Each emulator will be assinged port starting 5554
* telnet localhost 5554 <-- to connect by telnet
* Can send messages from emulators using port numbers
* can use avd command - 'avd stop' / 'avd start' can pause / start emulator, saves battery
* avd commands can also take snapshots
